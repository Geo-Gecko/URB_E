# city_monitoring
A GIS based repository of city monitoring products and their use.

The portal for this is http://citymonitoring.geogecko.com/


This greenspace portal shows the difference between the amount of avaliable greenspace and how that changed overtime (2016 - 2018)

The data is based on the monitoring the amount and health of the vegetation in the city.

This allows a user to tell just how fast the vegetation is being depleted
